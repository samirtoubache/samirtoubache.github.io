            <p>Hello there, my name is Samir Toubache. I am a second year computer engineering student at Queen&#39;s University specializing in software engineering. I also work part time at my universities IT support center where I help Queen's students and staff troubleshoot software problems.
            <br>
            <br>
            I am relatively new to programming, but I have already gained a working knowledge of C and Python through my coding courses and learned HTML/CSS through the Queen&#39;s Web development club (enough to build this website from scratch). Plus I am always learning new concepts on my own time. Right now I am learning file management and task automation with Linux as well as improving my understanding of C.
            <br>
            <br>
            I am always eager to learn new things and am currently very interested in any role that will help me learn more about software development.</p>

            <h1>Experience</h1>

            <p>These are some examples of real projects I worked on. So far I have only worked on websites, but the skils I learned in these projects are helpful in any type of development.</p>

                <p>QGEM Main Website<br><br>
Skills Developed: GIT, Updating a live website<br><br>
During the last summer I volunteered to help QGEM, a genetic engineering design team at Queen&#39;s, update their main website. I was mainly responsible for adding new content while ensuring that I don&#39;t unintentionally interfere with the old code. The website was hosted on GitHub, so I naturally used GIT to update it. I had very little prior GIT experience, so this opportunity really helped me get comfortable using GIT in the terminal. I ended up creating the following pages: <a href="http://queensigem.ca/synbiolanding.html">Synthetic Biology Landing</a>, <a href="http://queensigem.ca/plasmidconstruction.html">Plasmid Construction</a> and <a href="http://queensigem.ca/plantprotein.html">Plant-Based Proteins</a> in addition to making other small changes on old pages.

                <p>QGEM 2019 Project Website<br><br>
Skills Developed: Working in new development environments, following strict development rules<br><br>
In addition to updating the main website, I also lead the creation of QGEM&#39;s 2019 project website. This website was hosted on iGEM&#39;s server, the group organizing the yearly competition. I had to use iGEM&#39;s unique development environment and follow their rules (ex. No externally hosted material, long file naming conventions, code template system, etc., etc., etc.). In the end, I am quite happy with the result, though another individual did take over the project near the start of the school year since I am very busy with classes. I completed the following sections: <a href="https://2019.igem.org/Team:Queens_Canada">Home page</a>, <a href="https://2019.igem.org/Team:Queens_Canada/Team">Meet the Team</a>, <a href="https://2019.igem.org/Team:Queens_Canada/Attributions">Attributions</a>,<a href="https://2019.igem.org/Team:Queens_Canada/Description">Project Description</a>, <a href="https://2019.igem.org/Team:Queens_Canada/Background">Project Background</a> and <a href="https://2019.igem.org/Team:Queens_Canada/Human_Practices">Human Practices Overview</a>.

                <p>Dr. Jia Main Website<br><br>
Skills Developed: Working with Legacy code<br><br>
In this relatively short project, I helped Dr. Jia, a professor at Queen&#39;s, update his website. His website was starting to lose functionality, mainly because the code was very outdated. The website was originally built with frontpage 2003 which auto-generated very messy and hard to read code blocks. While working on this project, I had to spend extra time trying to understand the code and ensuring any additions that I made did not conflict with the old code.  You can look at the current website <a href="http://structure.biochem.queensu.ca/">here</a>. The main features I added were updating/fixing the navigation header, adding publication links, and simplifying the website file structure.
